# LLM Context Files

This section provides access to specially formatted files intended for consumption by Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide context about the HyperBEAM documentation.

1.  **[LLM Summary (llms.txt)](../llms.txt)**
    *   **Content**: Contains a brief summary of the HyperBEAM documentation structure and a list of relative file paths for all markdown documents included in the build.
    *   **Usage**: Useful for providing an LLM with a high-level overview and the available navigation routes within the documentation.

2.  **[LLM Full Content (llms-full.txt)](../llms-full.txt)**
    *   **Content**: A single text file containing the complete, concatenated content of all markdown documents from the specified documentation directories (`begin`, `run`, `guides`, `devices`, `resources`). Each file's content is clearly demarcated.
    *   **Usage**: Ideal for feeding the entire documentation content into an LLM for comprehensive context, analysis, or question-answering based on the full documentation set.

!!! note "Generation Process"
    These files are automatically generated by the `docs/build-all.sh` script during the documentation build process. They consolidate information from the following directories:

    *   `docs/begin`
    *   `docs/run`
    *   `docs/guides`
    *   `docs/devices`
    *   `docs/resources`
