# Converge HTTP API Design notes
### Date: 11 Jan, 2025.

The Converge protocol is designed to layer a computation system on top of
HTTP Semantics. As such, it offers syntax for HTTP requests that allow users to
easily manipulate and traverse through the computation graph. This document
describes the semantics and syntax of the Converge HTTP API.

## Semantics and syntax

- All paths for typical computations start with a base hashpath:
```
GET /hashpath1/...
```
- All keys after the base are interpreted as Converge messages individually, in 
a chain. For example, `GET /hashpath1/key1/key2` is equivalent to:
```
GET /hashpath(hashpath1, key1)/key2
```
- Each path segment is interpreted as a key to resolve upon the message for the
resolution of the previous message. The `key` is taken as the full path for
that message during that resolution.
- When Converge is not given a base hashpath (the first key is not a 43 character
base64URL encoded string), the request message is assumed to be its own base
message, with the path applied alone as the request (`Message2`).
- Query parameters are treated as equivalent to headers.
- When not otherwise specified, a query parameter or header is interpreted as
being present in all messages in the path, in addition to the path key.
- `+` in path segments delimits the `key` and an optional message dictionary. 
For example, `GET /hashpath1/key1+dict1=val1/key2` adds `dict1=val1` to the
message for the resolution of the `key1` key.
- `N.KeyName` in headers or query parameters is interpreted as `KeyName` in the
message dictionary for the resolution of the `N`th key.
- `Key~DevName` in a path segment is interpreted as executing the message with
the `Device` set to `DevName`.
- A dictionary key of form `Key|Type` is interpreted as a type annotation for
`Key`, which can be used to parse the value of the key using HTTP Structured
Fields (RFC 8941).
- Parentheses in key or path segments are interpreted as the result of the 
enclosed path, as if it were an independent invocation. For example, 
`GET /hashpath1/path2+key1=(/hashpath2/key2)` implies that `key1` in the 
message for the resolution of `path2` is the result of the invocation of 
`/hashpath2/key2`.

## Example workflows

Get the current routes:
```
curl http://host:port/Routes
```

Set a route for a specific path:
```
curl -X POST http://host:port/Routes -H "Priority: 10" \
    -H "Node: http://host:port" -H "Template: /Some/New/Path"
```

Schedule a message on a process:
```
curl -X POST http://host:port/ProcID/Schedule -H "Action: Transfer" \
    -H "Recipient: Address" -H "Quantity: 1337"
```

Run a WASM executable:
```
curl -X POST http://host:port/Init/Compute -H "Device: WASM-64/1.0" \
    -H "2.WASM-Function: fac" -H "2.WASM-Params: [10]" -d @test/test-64.wasm
```

...returning response with a `Hashpath` header. To execute further messages
on the result, use the `Hashpath` as the base hashpath for the next message:
```
curl http://host:port/Hashpath/Compute/Results -H "WASM-Function: fac" \
    -H "WASM-Params: [11]" -d @test/test-64.wasm
```

Assign a message from one process's outbox to the schedule of another:
```
curl -X POST http://host:port/ProcID2/Schedule+Message= \
    (/ProcID1/Compute+Slot=1/Results/Outbox/1)
```

This request is equivalent to:
```
curl http://host:port/Hashpath/Compute/Results?WASM-Function=fac&WASM-Params=[11]
```

Load the WASM computation from an existing hashpath:
```
curl -X POST http://host:port/Init/Compute \
    -H "1.WASM-Image|Resolve: /OldHashpath/Snapshot/WASM" \
    -H "2.WASM-Function: fac" -H "2.WASM-Params: [10]"
```

To fork an existing process to use a new device, we can use the `~` key operator:
```
curl -X POST http://host:port/Schedule~Process/2.0/(/ProcID/Now)+Method=POST
```

To run multiple computations in the same request, with separate headers for
each, we should be able to use `Header#N` modifiers:
```
curl -X POST http://host:port/Init/Compute/Compute -H "Device: WASM-64/1.0" \
    -H "2.WASM-Function: fac" -H "2.WASM-Params: [10]" \
    -H "3.WASM-Function: fac" -H "3.WASM-Params: [11]" \
    -d @test/test-64.wasm
```

This request is equivalent to:
```
curl http://host:port/Init+Device=WASM-64/1.0+Image=ID/Compute+ \
    WASM-Function=fac+WASM-Params=[10]/Compute+WASM-Function=fac&WASM-Params=[11]
```

Gather the node's known attestations (including its own) on a process output:
```
curl http://host:port/ProcID/Compute+Slot=1/Results/Attestations
```

Dry-run a message on top of an AO process state:
```
curl -X POST http://host:port/ProcID/Compute \
    -H "Action: Balance" -H "Recipient: Address"
```
