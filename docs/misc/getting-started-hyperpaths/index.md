# HyperPATHs

## Overview

HyperPATHs provides a comprehensive set of HTTP endpoints for interacting with HyperBEAM nodes and accessing process data. This section covers various ways to extract value and interact with HyperBEAM through HTTP requests.

## Key Concepts

- **HTTP Endpoints**: Access process data and node information through standardized HTTP endpoints
- **Cryptographic Signatures**: All responses are cryptographically signed for data integrity
- **State Management**: Various methods for accessing and updating process states
- **Node Interaction**: Tools for interacting with HyperBEAM nodes

## Best Practices

1. Always verify cryptographic signatures on responses
2. Use appropriate caching strategies for frequently accessed data
3. Implement proper error handling for network requests
4. Consider rate limits and performance implications
5. Keep sensitive data secure and use appropriate authentication methods

## Common Use Cases

- Real-time process state monitoring
- Data synchronization between processes
- Building web interfaces for AO processes
- Automated process management and monitoring
- Cross-process communication and data sharing
