# The HyperBEAM Style Guide.

**Rule one of style guide club:** _We do not talk about style guide club._

We are here to build a fully decentralized alternative to cyberspace as it 
is currently constructed. We are not interested in long conversations about
where to put commas or spaces.

**Rule two of style guide club:** _Blend in._

Write your code as if you were the author of all of the existing code. If all 
of the other code is written in a certain style, then copy it. If the style
of the code in your PR would not _blend in_, then its style is objectively
in violation of `style guide club`'s rules.

In the event of disagreement, a simple rule should guide our decisions: What
does the majority of the LoC in the codebase already do? Do that. Then get 
back to hacking.

If you don't like something about the style, simply contribute. If others
disagree strongly, the existing style will be kept. If your contributions are
seen by others as reasonable and inline with the canon, then it will gradually 
become adopted as the standard in the codebase.

**This concludes the rules of style guide club.**

Remember: Cypherpunks write code! There is no time to bicker about
trivialities. ðŸ«¡
