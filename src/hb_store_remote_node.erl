%%% A store module that reads data from another AO node.
%%% Notably, this store only provides the _read_ side of the store interface.
%%% The write side could be added, returning an attestation that the data has
%%% been written to the remote node. In that case, the node would probably want
%%% to upload it to an Arweave bundler to ensure persistence, too.
