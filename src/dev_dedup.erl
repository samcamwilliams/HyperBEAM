%%% @doc A device that deduplicates messages in an evaluation stream, returning
%%% status `skip' if the message has already been seen.
%%%
%%% This device is typically used to ensure that a message is only executed
%%% once, even if assigned multiple times, upon a `~process@1.0' evaluation.
%%% It can, however, be used in many other contexts.
%%%
%%% This device honors the `pass' key if it is present in the message. If so,
%%% it will only run on the first pass. Additionally, the device supports
%%% a `subject-key' key that allows the caller to specify the key whose ID
%%% should be used for deduplication. If the `subject-key' key is not present,
%%% the device will use the `body' of the request as the subject. If the key is
%%% set to `request', the device will use the entire request itself as the
%%% subject.
%%%
%%% This device runs on the first pass of the `compute' key call if executed
%%% in a stack, and not in subsequent passes. Currently the device stores its
%%% list of already seen items in memory, but at some point it will likely make
%%% sense to drop them in the cache.
