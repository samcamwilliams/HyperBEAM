%%% @doc A module that implements a 'friends and family' pricing policy.
%%% It will allow users to process requests only if their addresses are
%%% in the allow-list for the node.
%%% 
%%% Fundamentally against the spirit of permissionlessness, but it is useful if
%%% you are running a node for your own purposes and would not like to allow 
%%% others to make use of it -- even for a fee. It also serves as a useful
%%% example of how to implement a custom pricing policy, as it implements stubs
%%% for both the pricing and ledger P4 APIs.
-module(dev_faff).
%%% Pricing API
%%% We only implement `estimate/3' as we do not want to charge for requests, so
%%% we are fine with the estimate being the same as the price.
-export([estimate/3]).
%%% Ledger API
%%% We need to implement `debit/3' as it is required by the ledger API, but we
%%% do not want to charge for requests, so we return `ok' and do not actually
%%% debit the user's account. Similarly, we are not interested in taking payments
%%% from users, so we do not implement `credit/3'.
-export([debit/3]).
-include("include/hb.hrl").
