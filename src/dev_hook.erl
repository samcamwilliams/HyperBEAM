%%% @doc A generalized interface for `hooking' into HyperBEAM nodes.
%%% 
%%% This module allows users to define `hooks' that are executed at various
%%% points in the lifecycle of nodes and message evaluations.
%%% 
%%% Hooks are maintained in the `node message' options, under the key `on'
%%% key. Each `hook' may have zero or many `handlers' which their request is
%%% executed against. A new `handler' of a hook can be registered by simply
%%% adding a new key to that message. If multiple hooks need to be executed for
%%% a single event, the key's value can be set to a list of hooks.
%%% 
%%% `hook's themselves do not need to be added explicitly. Any device can add
%%% a hook by simply executing `dev_hook:on(HookName, Req, Opts)`. This
%%% function is does not affect the hashpath of a message and is not exported on
%%% the device's API, such that it is not possible to call it directly with
%%% AO-Core resolution.
%%% 
%%% All handlers are expressed in the form of a message, upon which the hook's
%%% request is evaluated:
%%% 
%%%     AO(HookMsg, Req, Opts) => {Status, Result}
%%% 
%%% The `Status' and `Result' of the evaluation can be used at the `hook' caller's
%%% discretion. If multiple handlers are to be executed for a single `hook', the
%%% result of each is used as the input to the next, on the assumption that the
%%% status of the previous is `ok'. If a non-`ok' status is encountered, the
%%% evaluation is halted and the result is returned to the caller. This means
%%% that in most cases, hooks take the form of chainable pipelines of functions,
%%% passing the most pertinent data in the `body' key of both the request and
%%% result. Hook definitions can also set the `hook/result' key to `ignore', if
%%% the result of the execution should be discarded and the prior value (the
%%% input to the hook) should be used instead. The `hook/commit-request' key can
%%% also be set to `true' if the request should be committed by the node before
%%% execution of the hook.
%%% 
%%% The default HyperBEAM node implements several useful hooks. They include:
%%% 
%%%     start: Executed when the node starts.
%%%         Req/body: The node's initial configuration.
%%%         Result/body: The node's possibly updated configuration.
%%%     request: Executed when a request is received via the HTTP API.
%%%         Req/body: The sequence of messages that the node will evaluate.
%%%         Req/request: The raw, unparsed singleton request.
%%%         Result/body: The sequence of messages that the node will evaluate.
%%%     step: Executed after each message in a sequence has been evaluated.
%%%         Req/body: The result of the evaluation.
%%%         Result/body: The result of the evaluation.
%%%     response: Executed when a response is sent via the HTTP API.
%%%         Req/body: The result of the evaluation.
%%%         Req/request: The raw, unparsed singleton request that was used to
%%%             generate the response.
%%%         Result/body: The message to be sent in response to the request.
%%% 
%%% Additionally, this module implements a traditional device API, allowing the
%%% node operator to register hooks to the node and find those that are
%%% currently active.
