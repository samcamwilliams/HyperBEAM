--- A dynamic route generator in an AO `~process@1.0'.
--- This generator grants a routing table, found at `/now/routes', that is 
--- compatible with the `~router@1.0' interface. Subsequently, it can be
--- used for routing by HyperBEAM nodes' via setting the `route-provider'
--- node message key.
--- 
--- The configuration options are as follows:
--- /is-admissible = A message to call with the registration request's body. Should
---                return a boolean indicating whether the peer is admissible.
--- /sampling-rate = The frequency at which random sampling of registered nodes
---                should be performed, rather than scored routing. Default = 0.1.
--- /pricing-weight = The level to which pricing should be preferred relative to
---                performance in the scoring algorithm. Default = 1.
--- /performance-weight = The level to which performance should be preferred
---                relative to pricing in the scoring algorithm.
---                Default = 1.
--- /score-preference = The level to which the scoring algorithm influence routing
---                decisions amongst scored route generations. Default = 1,
---                yielding an exponential decay in preference for better
---                performing nodes. Default = 1.
--- /recalculate-every = The number of messages to process between recalculating
---                the routing table. Default = 1000.
